title: "Just show me how you changed the world"

I don't care about your university degree. I don't care about your certificates. Better yet, I don't even care about your technical skills, or how much money you've made. They are all just tools, a means to an end.

What I am interested in is what impact you had on the world so far. And what impact you are planning to have on it.
