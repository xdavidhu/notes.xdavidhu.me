title: "Burnout"
---

i like to have a possibly highly silly approach to burnout.

Think of it like being an athlete. Where you are constantly training to get better. Similar to how you would keep running further and further, day after day, until at one point you can, you know, run a marathon without stopping or something.

Would it be fun? Would it be easy? Well, probably not, but that's all fine. This is still just training. I'll have fun and work with ease later on, once I get really good. But I am not there yet. Not at all. --- And paradoxically, this approach is what makes the process fun, and motivating. The potential, I guess.

When things get difficult, I'd prefer to keep going. Maybe push it even further. So that instead of burning out, the original problems would get so small & easy that they wouldn't even get to me at all. Hence, I wouldn't burn out! (And I could reset my baseline - so everything I achieved so far would now be just nothing. Exciting! It actually really is.)

Or maybe this is the fast-track to losing all sense of meaning and motivation by age 25. But even if it is... I guess I say, bring it on, man.
