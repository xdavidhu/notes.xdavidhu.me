title: "Compensated"

I want to create so much value, that what I get back, even if its much smaller, will always be more than enough. And both circles will keep growing overtime.

![diagram showing a large and a small circle. the large circle has the label 'value i am creating' while the small circle has the label 'what i get compensated'](/assets/img/compensated/compensation.png)

Btw I like to believe this even works in a selfish way ðŸ˜‰

what iâ€™d get compensated if i only did what's required'](/assets/img/compensated/compensation2.png)
